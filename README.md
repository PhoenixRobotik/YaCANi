# YaCANi: Yet another CAN interface

The YaCANi is forked from the [CANtact project](https://github.com/CANtact/cantact-hw).
The goal is a smaller PCB with micro USB and a specific CAN connector (JST XH).

It can be opened and edited with [KiCad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org/).

You might be interested in others forks of this project:
- [Canable](http://canable.io/): smaller PCB than CANtact, designed on Eagle CAD
- [x893's fork](https://github.com/x893/cantact-hw): uses ADM3053 CAN transceiver (for it's isolation capability)
